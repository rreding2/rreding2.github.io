      <h1>WHAT US POPULATION SEGMENTS ARE MOST AT RISK OF SUICIDE?</h1>
      <p>
        Let's discover the answer by reviewing suicides per 100,000 people,
        slicing the data by:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Time</b>: Are US suicides increasing over time?</li>
        <li>
          <b>Country:</b>: Are people in the US more at risk than those in
          Canada?
        </li>
        <li><b>Sex:</b> Are US men or women more at risk of suicide?</li>
        <li>
          <b>Age Group:</b> Which US age groups are most at risk of suicide?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Then analyze the data by <b>Sex and Age Group</b> to decide for yourself
        which segment of the US population is most at risk.
